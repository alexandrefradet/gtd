# Notes Front

Note taking app which will be the first brick of my angular app for using the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) methodology (i'm currently reading the book).

Credits to [Devstackr Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPR5cr7nkTvq6kTV8rbr6BVz) which i'll used as a basis to help me get started as i haven't done much Angular lately and still need to improve a lot on my css (animation, transition, etc...)
